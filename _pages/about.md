I am an undergraduate at Tsinghua University with research interest in statistical machine learning, online learning and sequential decision making. I am extremenly lucky to be supervised by [Prof. Jie Ding](jding.org) and [Prof. Weina Wang](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~weinaw/) during my undergraduate study.

Miscellaneous

I enjoy music, choral arts and jazz dance in my free time. I am a member of Tsinghua Students Choir and my part is alto. I like to watch movies and TV plays too. I am a fan of the Netflix series *the Stranger Things* since high school.
